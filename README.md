# Bright Star Over Mountain
### Description
This is a program creating bright stars over mountains in a losing realistic generating way. Based on the mouse position, the moon in the program can change its shape and the stars can move their position.
### Randomness
In the inspiring image, there are a lot of bright stars all over the sky in a random position. The mountains in the image seem like they can be generated in a random way each time while generating. Thus, I generated some random polygon diagrams and circles to try to simulate the mountains and stars. The mountains’ shape is different every time. For stars, the size, position, and color are created by applying random in the generation. 
### Reactivity
The input I am collecting from the user is the mouse position. Moon’s position and size are changing based on the user’s mouse position. Stars are also moving a little bit base on that.
### Statement
I am trying to create a simulator that can generate some bright stars over mountains which is different each time. Normally, when we take photos, the moon and stars are moving in a circle orbital which is centered based on where the person is. The moon moves like on a circle orbital now. However, the stars were moving centered by themselves’ small circle. Thus, I reduce the star moving scale to make the star moves on both the x-axis and y-axis but not pretty obvious where is the center of the moving orbital.
